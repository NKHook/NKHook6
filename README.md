# NKHook6
NKHook6 is a high level and portable BTD6 API while not compromising versatility or ease of use.

## Purpose
Our plan here with NKHook6 is to provide novice programmers with the tools necessary to get them started.

## Why NKHook6
Most other mod "Apis" for Bloons TD 6 really don't do much for the mod maker. NKHook6 on the other hand, follows a standard set by the [NKHook6 API](https://github.com/NKHook/NKHook6-API) repository. Every other "api" at the time of writing this README does not have such a standard, and as a result leads to some rather... "interesting" "api" design. You may have noticed that I've put quotes around every time I've mentioned "api" when talking about other projects. This is because, in reality, most of these projects are true Apis in the sense that its a new layer for interecting with the game, rather its just a collection of functions and such to make work on the same level as the game code a little easier. **This doesn't help modders.** Since this structure doesn't actually help new modders create mods easily, not only are these "apis" not "true" apis, but they also fail at their intended goal of helping new (and experienced) modders create mods.
